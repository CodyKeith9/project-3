##  Overview

*Knode.Task* is a modern, minimalist task management app built with React. Designed for speed, clarity, and style, it provides users with an elegant interface to track daily to-dos. Each task is visualized as a node on a vertical timeline, alternating between the left and right sides of the screen to guide focus and create a flowing experience.

This app was built to fulfill the requirements of a Software Engineering project, focusing on CRUD functionality, modern UI/UX design, and responsive behavior.

## Features

-  Add, complete, and delete to-do tasks
-  Filter by All / Completed / Incomplete
-  Persistent task timeline with alternating vertical layout
-  Contact form (first name, last name, email, message)
-  Responsive design for mobile and desktop
-  Clean styling with translucent modals, gold accents, and visual feedback
-  Modular components and clear state management

---

## Technologies Used

- React (via Create React App)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- CSS3 (custom styling and media queries)
- React Router DOM (for page routing)
- Git & GitHub (version control and deployment)

---

## App Structure

- `/todos` – main to-do manager view
- `/contact` – contact form view
- `TaskForm.jsx`, `TaskTree.jsx`, `ContactForm.jsx`, etc. – reusable components

---

## How to Use

1. Navigate to the `/todos` page.
2. Add your custom task using the input bar.
3. Mark tasks complete, delete them, or filter your view.
4. Visit the `/contact` page to fill out and submit a contact form.

### Ideas for Future Improvement

1. **Add localStorage or backend support** to persist tasks between sessions.
2. **Implement drag-and-drop task reordering.**
3. **Introduce task categories or priorities** for better organization.
4. Add form submission to email or backend API.
5. Port to React native for app deployment? 
6. Add point system for better funtionality and store for purchase options with points for scalability. 
7. implement more functions and better use of CSS. This isn't my strongest submission.
